# Environment configuration for your Next.js app

# Although NODE_ENV is set automatically by Next.js,
# you can override it here (e.g., for local testing).
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=production

# Example: Define a public API URL that can be accessed on both client and server.
# Only variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

# Add any additional environment variables below.
# For production deployment, these are often set via your hosting provider.
